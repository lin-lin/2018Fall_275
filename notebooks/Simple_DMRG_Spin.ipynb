    "The new connecting component $S_{j}^z$ and $S_{j}^{+}$ is also defined on the enlarged space via the tensor product. Note that `kron` uses the tensor product convention making that the second block is indexed first. In other words, Julia uses the column-major convention for vectors and matrices, but the ordering of the blocks follows the row-major convention.\n",

    "The finite DMRG algorithm first performs a \"warmup\" sweeping step using the infinite DMRG algorithm to reach site L. Then the blocks are stored on a \"disk\" (in this case memory).  In the consequent sweeping steps, the finite system DMRG first sweeps from left to right, and then right to left. The use of the name `sys` and `env` rather than `left` and `right` is mainly for the finite system DMRG, where `sys` and `env` alternatively assumes the role of `left` and `right` in different sweeping steps. \n",
